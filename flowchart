# Issue Management Workflow

This document describes the issue management workflow process across different organizational lanes: Customer, DGE, DevOps, Engineering, and PM.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow manages the lifecycle of issues from initial customer request through resolution and release, with clear handoffs between different teams and roles.

## Process Flow

### Customer Lane
1. **New Issue** - Initial issue creation
2. **Screen and Tag Issue** - Initial triage and categorization
3. **Potential Issue?** - Decision point to determine if issue is valid
   - **No** → Assign to DGE & Investigate
   - **Yes** → Work to Prioritize Issue

### DGE (Data Governance & Engineering) Lane
4. **Assign to DGE & Investigate** - Deep technical investigation
5. **Additional Information Required** - Request more details if needed
6. **Updated Issue/Answer Question** - Provide clarification or resolution
7. **Close Issue** - Final closure of non-actionable issues

### DevOps Lane
8. **T-Ops Internal as Sev 2.5** - Internal operational severity classification
9. **On Call owns SM** - On-call engineer takes ownership of service management
10. **Confirm/Set Priority in Triage Meetings** - Priority setting in team meetings

### Engineering Lane
11. **Question/Incorrect Usage?** - Determine if issue is usage-related
    - **Yes** → Reproduced as Bug or Feature Request
    - **No** → Update Issue with Release Info
12. **Feature Request** or **Bug** - Classification of actionable items
13. **Should Ready Tasks to Assign in Next Sprint** - Sprint planning preparation
14. **High Sev Bug Work into Current Sprint** - Urgent bug handling
15. **Release** - Code deployment and release
16. **Asana Task** - Task tracking in project management system

### PM (Product Management) Lane
17. **Update Issue with Release Info** - Communication of resolution details
18. **Close Issue** - Final issue closure with customer notification

## Key Decision Points

### Potential Issue Assessment
- **Criteria**: Technical validity, business impact, resource requirements
- **Outcomes**: 
  - Valid issues proceed to prioritization
  - Invalid issues go to investigation

### Question/Incorrect Usage Classification
- **Criteria**: Root cause analysis, user error vs system defect
- **Outcomes**:
  - Usage issues get documentation updates
  - System defects become bugs or feature requests

### Priority Classification
- **High Severity**: Immediate sprint inclusion
- **Standard Priority**: Next sprint planning
- **Low Priority**: Backlog management

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Customer
- Issue reporting and initial description
- Providing additional information when requested
- Validation of resolution

### DGE (Data Governance & Engineering)
- Technical investigation of complex issues
- Root cause analysis
- Technical documentation and knowledge base updates

### DevOps
- Operational impact assessment
- Service management and monitoring
- Priority setting based on system impact

### Engineering
- Bug reproduction and fixing
- Feature development
- Code review and testing
- Release management

### PM (Product Management)
- Stakeholder communication
- Release coordination
- Customer notification
- Issue lifecycle management

## Workflow States

1. **New** - Initial state
2. **Investigating** - Under technical review
3. **Prioritized** - Scheduled for development
4. **In Progress** - Active development
5. **Ready for Release** - Completed and tested
6. **Released** - Deployed to production
7. **Closed** - Final resolution communicated

## Success Metrics

- **Time to Resolution**: Average time from issue creation to closure
- **First Response Time**: Time to initial acknowledgment
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Resolution quality feedback
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of issues requiring escalation
- **Recurrence Rate**: Percentage of issues that reopen

## Process Improvements

### Automation Opportunities
- Automatic severity classification based on keywords
- Integration between issue tracking and sprint planning tools
- Automated customer notifications for status changes

### Communication Enhancements
- Regular status updates to stakeholders
- Clear escalation paths for urgent issues
- Standardized templates for different issue types

## Tools Integration

- **Issue Tracking**: Primary system for workflow management
- **Asana**: Task and project management
- **Communication**: Slack/Teams for real-time coordination
- **Monitoring**: System alerts and performance metrics
- **Documentation**: Knowledge base for common issues and solutions
